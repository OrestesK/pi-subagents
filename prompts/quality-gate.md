description: Quality gate with adversarial parallel review
---

Run a quality gate on the current answer, plan, diff, PR, issue, or target.

Primary target or focus:

$@

This workflow is quality-first. Do not avoid useful reviewers merely to save cost. Use fresh context unless I explicitly ask for forked context. Before launching children, hydrate the target: read/fetch the referenced file, diff, URL, issue, PR, plan, log, screenshot, or quoted claim enough to name the concrete scope. Include that concrete target and any relevant paths/links in every child task. The child reviewers should inspect the target directly from files, diffs, linked sources, commands, or fetched content; they must not rely on the main conversation history.

Runtime policy:

- Use the `subagent` tool with parallel fresh-context reviewers.
- Set `async: true`, retain the run ID, and yield after any qualifying parent work; the completion notification resumes the parent.
- Do not emit the verdict until completion and direct inspection of the reviewer outputs.
- If the user says `no repo artifacts`, `no project artifacts`, or `don't write .scratch files`, also set top-level `artifacts: false` and keep every child `output: false` and `progress: false`.
- If the user says strict `do not write artifacts`, `no files`, or `inline only`, do not launch subagents; gate parent-only or ask to relax that constraint.
- Prefer three strong reviewers for normal work and add a fourth or fifth when the target is large, security-sensitive, ops-heavy, architecture-heavy, or ambiguous.
- Do not spawn duplicate vague reviewers.
- For broader grouped gates or missing-evidence follow-ups, use the sectioned-swarm protocol in `packages/pi-subagents/skills/pi-subagents/SKILL.md`: name the new evidence angle before launching any second targeted read-only swarm.
- Every child task should include this compact stop/block contract: Do not stop to save cost; continue while additional evidence could materially improve the deliverable. If blocked by missing tools, missing access, or missing context, return `BLOCKED` with the smallest missing next step. Do not broaden scope or make approval-required decisions.

Before emitting the verdict:

- Inspect the actual returned inline reviewer text or read every referenced saved artifact.
- Remember that `output: false` means no saved file output, not no evidence requirement.
- If reviewer findings are too large or too compact to inspect inline, use distinct saved outputs with `outputMode: "file-only"` when artifacts are allowed.
- Under repo-scoped no-artifact constraints, return `INCONCLUSIVE` or ask to relax the constraint instead of synthesizing from receipts or session directories alone.

Default angles:

1. Correctness/regression adversary
   Attack whether the target satisfies the request, preserves behavior, handles edge cases, and avoids hidden runtime failures.

2. Tests/verification adversary
   Attack whether the evidence actually proves the claim. Check tests, typecheck/lint/build commands, manual validation, missing red/green evidence, and stale or insufficient verification.

3. Simplicity/maintainability adversary
   Attack unnecessary complexity, duplication, vague abstractions, brittle ownership boundaries, misleading names, and cleanup that is clearly worth doing.

Add these when relevant:

- Security/privacy adversary for auth, permissions, secrets, data exposure, untrusted input/output, or destructive actions.
- Ops/resource adversary for tmp/log/session pressure, concurrency, cloud resources, migrations, deploy risk, rollback, or observability.
- User-preference/adoption adversary for workflow, UX, documentation, or behavior that might violate known user preferences.

Recommended runtime shape:

```typescript
subagent({
  tasks: [
    {
      agent: "reviewer",
      task: "Quality gate: attack correctness and regression risk for <target>. Inspect files/diffs/sources directly. Return concise evidence-backed findings with severity and file/line references where applicable. Do not edit.",
      output: false,
      progress: false,
    },
    {
      agent: "reviewer",
      task: "Quality gate: attack tests and verification evidence for <target>. Identify missing, stale, weak, or overclaimed validation. Return concise evidence-backed findings. Do not edit.",
      output: false,
      progress: false,
    },
    {
      agent: "reviewer",
      task: "Quality gate: attack simplicity and maintainability for <target>. Flag only concrete issues that affect correctness, reasoning, testability, or future change cost. Do not edit.",
      output: false,
      progress: false,
    },
  ],
  concurrency: 3,
  context: "fresh",
  async: true,
});
```

After the completion notification, inspect the reviewer outputs and perform the mandatory parent synthesis. Do not outsource the final decision to a child. Reviewer findings cannot amend the active task contract or authorize edits. Classify feedback as:

- must-fix now;
- should-fix now;
- optional/defer;
- reject/ignore with reason;
- ask user because applying it changes product, architecture, security, data, or scope.

Then emit a structured gate verdict:

```text
Verdict: PASS | FAIL | INCONCLUSIVE
Blocking findings: <count and one-line list>
Evidence inspected: <commands/files/artifacts actually inspected>
Decision: <claim allowed, claim blocked, or more evidence needed>
```

Blocking rule:

- `FAIL` when any accepted must-fix remains, required verification is missing/stale, a reviewer found a real unresolved correctness/security/ops blocker, or the target cannot support the claim being gated.
- `INCONCLUSIVE` when the reviewers lacked access to the target, evidence is incomplete, tool failures prevent inspection, or the parent cannot reconcile contradictory reviewer findings.
- `PASS` only when no accepted must-fix remains, required evidence is fresh enough for the claim, and the parent can state why should-fix/optional findings do not block.

This gate is review and synthesis only. Do not edit files, launch a fix worker, or apply fixes from `/quality-gate` itself. If the target needs changes, report the accepted findings against the current contract and the next authorized fix workflow. Stop and ask when a finding needs another file, range, behavior, changed-line budget, or an unapproved product, architecture, compatibility, dependency, security, data, or scope decision.
